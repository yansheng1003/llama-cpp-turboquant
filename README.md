[![Codec papers](https://img.shields.io/badge/codec-turboquant__plus-orange.svg)](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus)

A fork of [ggml-org/llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) integrating the **TurboQuant+** codec stack — Walsh-Hadamard rotated polar quantization, attention-gated sparse dequantization, and layer-aware V compression policies. The codec design, calibration, and validation papers live at [TheTom/turboquant_plus](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus); this repository is the llama.cpp runtime integration.

### Lineage — why the `+`

TurboQuant+ is inspired by Google's original **TurboQuant** paper (ICLR 2026), which introduced Walsh-Hadamard-rotated polar codebook quantization for KV cache and demonstrated 4.6× compression at ~1% PPL loss. This project extends that foundation substantially — adding the asymmetric K/V policy (V is free, K is everything), layer-aware Boundary V protection, attention-gated sparse V dequantization, the `TQ3_1S` / `TQ4_1S` weight quantization formats, the `turbo2` / `turbo4` tier variants, the cross-backend kernel coverage (CUDA `dp4a`, HIP/ROCm RDNA/CDNA, Vulkan coopmat, Metal TurboFlash + V2.1 fused kernels), and a body of model-family-specific quality and operational fixes. The trailing `+` denotes that ongoing extension work; the original TurboQuant codec remains the foundation.

This fork is additive: every existing llama.cpp quantization, model, and backend continues to work unchanged. New types are opt-in via the standard `--cache-type-k` / `--cache-type-v` and `llama-quantize` interfaces.

## Production deployments

This fork's TurboQuant integration is used in:

- [**LocalAI**](https://localai.io) — drop-in OpenAI-compatible local inference server
- [**Chronara**](https://chronara.io) — quantum-safe fintech infrastructure with AI-driven networks
- [**AtomicChat**](https://atomic.chat/) — on-device chat application

## What this fork adds

### Quantization types

| Type | Domain | Approx. bits | Notes | Paper |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `TQ3_1S` | weights | ~3.5 | smaller VRAM than `q8_0` | [weight-compression-tq4](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/weight-compression-tq4.md) |
| `TQ4_1S` | weights | ~4.5 | V2.1 fused Metal kernels; CUDA `dp4a` 3.5× faster (240 t/s vs 68 baseline) | [weight-compression-tq4](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/weight-compression-tq4.md) |
| `turbo2` | KV cache | ~2.0 | aggressive; pair with Boundary V | [block-size-experiment](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/block-size-experiment.md) |
| `turbo3` | KV cache | ~3.5 | ~4.6× compression at <1.5% PPL loss | [attn-rotation-and-ppl-artifact](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/attn-rotation-and-ppl-artifact.md) |
| `turbo4` | KV cache | ~4.5 | rehabilitated to beat `q4_0` on fidelity | [turbo4-resurrection](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/turbo4-resurrection.md) |

All turbo formats use Walsh-Hadamard rotation followed by polar codebook quantization on 128-element blocks. Why this works where MSE-driven codecs fail: [why-mse-fails-for-kv-quantization](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/why-mse-fails-for-kv-quantization.md).

### Compression policies

- **Auto-asymmetric K/V compression** — recognizes that V tolerates aggressive compression while K does not; default policy picks complementary codecs rather than symmetric. [asymmetric-kv-compression](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/asymmetric-kv-compression.md)
- **Boundary V (experimental, layer-aware)** — auto-enabled for `turbo2-V`. Protects layers where aggressive V quantization degrades quality, leaves the rest at full aggression. [layer-aware-v-compression](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/layer-aware-v-compression.md), [moe-v-compression-frontier](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/moe-v-compression-frontier.md)
- **Sparse V dequantization** — skip V dequantization for positions whose softmax attention weight falls below threshold. Enabled across all Metal targets. [sparse-v-dequant](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/sparse-v-dequant.md)

### Backend coverage

| Backend | Quant kernels | Flash Attention | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Metal** (Apple Silicon) | TQ V2.1 fused, TurboFlash | Yes — sparse V across the family; `dk=512` FA kernels for Gemma 4 | TurboFlash off by default on Apple10 (corruption regression under investigation). [m5-max-stress-test](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/m5-max-stress-test.md) |
| **CUDA** (NVIDIA) | `dp4a` for `TQ4_1S`, warp-cooperative dequant (16× less compute per block), multi-token / multi-GPU | Yes — turbo VEC FA (+9% decode); mixed `f16/bf16 + q8_0` without `GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS` | Load-time `TQ4_1S → q8_0` conversion path |
| **HIP / ROCm** (AMD) | Portable `ggml_cuda_dp4a`; scalar half path for `TQ4_1S` on AMD | Yes — VEC FA forced for quantized KV; pool bypass for FA f16 temp buffers | RDNA3 (gfx1100), RDNA4, CDNA3 (MI300X / gfx942), CDNA4 (MI355X / gfx950). [cross-engine-mi300x](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/cross-engine-mi300x.md) |
| **Vulkan** | `TQ4_1S` weights, `SET_ROWS` for `turbo2`/`turbo4` | coopmat flash attention with `turbo3` KV | Compute-shader path; nix-buildable |

### Model-family support

- **Gemma 4** — `dk=512` Metal FA kernels, MoE token routing, op-concurrency handling
- **Large MoE** — kernel instantiations for up to 256-expert routing
- **Hybrid architectures (GDN, Mamba)** — speculative decoding cherry-picked from upstream feature branches
- All existing llama.cpp model families remain fully supported

### Operational fixes carried by this fork

- CPU `vec_dot` heap-allocation fix for turbo / TQ types at `n > 4096`
- Apple Silicon unified-memory explosion fix
- RPC `GGML_OP_COUNT` assertion fix
- Cross-vendor `-Werror` build fixes
- Defensive `xxd.cmake` handling for missing input files

---

## Quick start

Standard llama.cpp build flags. TurboQuant types become available automatically once the matching backend is compiled in.

```bash
# Apple Silicon (Metal)
cmake -B build -DGGML_METAL=ON && cmake --build build -j

# NVIDIA CUDA
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON && cmake --build build -j

# AMD HIP / ROCm (multi-arch fat binary)
cmake -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES="gfx1100;gfx942;gfx950" && cmake --build build -j

# Vulkan
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=ON && cmake --build build -j
```

## Usage

### KV-cache quantization (runtime)

KV-cache types are selected per-side via the standard `--cache-type-k` / `--cache-type-v` flags.

> **Start light, then compress.** Some model families — small models, certain MoE configurations, quant-sensitive instruction-tuned variants — are more delicate than others. Pick a light asymmetric configuration first, verify output quality (eyeball + PPL on a hold-out set) on your specific model, then ratchet up V aggression if you have memory headroom to gain. **Do not start at maximum compression** and work backwards.

The core finding from the asymmetric-kv-compression paper — [**Asymmetric K/V Cache Compression: Why V is Free and K is Everything**](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/asymmetric-kv-compression.md) — drives all the configs below: **V tolerates aggressive compression, K does not**. Always keep K at higher precision than V; never start symmetric. That paper documents the specific failure modes you'll hit if you ignore this and compress K aggressively (PPL blow-up on certain model families, attention-rotation interaction with low-bit K, etc.) — read it before considering step 6.

Higher turbo number = more bits per element = less aggressive compression. The V-side compression ladder is `turbo4` (lightest) → `turbo3` → `turbo2` (heaviest). On the K side, prefer `f16` or `q8_0`; never lead with a turbo K.

Recommendations, ordered from most conservative to most aggressive:

| Step | `--cache-type-k` | `--cache-type-v` | When | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Safest start** | `f16` | `turbo4` | First contact with any new model | K untouched, V at the lightest turbo tier. If output isn't faithful at this step, the model is unusually quant-sensitive — stop and investigate before escalating. |
| **2. Conservative** | `q8_0` | `turbo4` | Verified safe at step 1, want a memory win without much risk | Light on both sides. Typically near-indistinguishable from `f16`/`f16` outputs. |
| **3. Recommended default** | `q8_0` | `turbo3` | Most dense models, most production workloads | The "asymmetric turbo" sweet spot from the [asymmetric-kv-compression](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/asymmetric-kv-compression.md) paper. Near-lossless K, ~4.6× compressed V. Total KV ~3-4× smaller than `f16`/`f16`. |
| **4. Aggressive V** | `q8_0` | `turbo2` | Memory-bound long context, after validating quality at step 3 | Boundary V auto-engages and protects sensitive layers. Expect <2% PPL loss on dense models outside the protected layers. |
| **5. MoE-aware aggressive** | `q8_0` | `turbo2` | Large MoE models (DeepSeek, Qwen3.6, Mixtral-style) | Same flags; Boundary V's per-expert-boundary protection is what makes this work on MoE. See [moe-v-compression-frontier](https://github.com/TheTom/turboquant_plus/blob/main/docs/papers/moe-v-compression-frontier.md). |
| **6. Discouraged: symmetric K compression** | any `turbo*` | any `turbo*` | Only with model-specific quality validation in hand | Compressing K is where models break. The asymmetric paper documents the failure modes. Not a starting point. |

Example invocations:

```bash
# Step 1 — safest start (first contact with a new model)
llama-cli -m model.gguf --cache-type-k f16 --cache-type-v turbo4 -p "..."

# Step 3 — recommended default (asymmetric turbo)
llama-cli -m model.gguf --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v turbo3 -p "..."

# Step 4 — aggressive V at long context
llama-cli -m model.gguf --cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v turbo2 -c 131072 -p "..."
```

If output quality drops between steps, walk back to the previous step. The compression frontier is per-model — there is no global "best" setting.

### Weight quantization (offline)

Weight quantization is selected at conversion time via `llama-quantize`:

```bash
# TQ4_1S — recommended for most CUDA / HIP deployments (dp4a 3.5× faster than baseline)
llama-quantize model.f16.gguf model.tq4_1s.gguf TQ4_1S

# TQ3_1S — smaller, accept ~1-2 PPL bump
llama-quantize model.f16.gguf model.tq3_1s.gguf TQ3_1S
```

### Automatic behavior

The following activate based on the selected types — no flags required:

- **Auto-asymmetric K/V** — when both sides are turbo / TQ types, the policy picks complementary configurations rather than symmetric.
- **Boundary V (layer-aware)** — auto-enables for any `turbo2-V` selection.
- **Sparse V dequantization** — on Metal targets, sparse V activates for all turbo V types.
- **Flash Attention** — auto-enabled for turbo KV with the relevant backend kernel.

See the linked papers above for parameter selection guidance on a per-model basis.

## Description

The main goal of `llama.cpp` is to enable LLM inference with minimal setup and state-of-the-art performance on a wide
range of hardware - locally and in the cloud.

- Plain C/C++ implementation without any dependencies
- Apple silicon is a first-class citizen - optimized via ARM NEON, Accelerate and Metal frameworks
- AVX, AVX2, AVX512 and AMX support for x86 architectures
- RVV, ZVFH, ZFH, ZICBOP and ZIHINTPAUSE support for RISC-V architectures
- 1.5-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, 4-bit, 5-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit integer quantization for faster inference and reduced memory use
- Custom CUDA kernels for running LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD GPUs via HIP and Moore Threads GPUs via MUSA)
- Vulkan and SYCL backend support
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference to partially accelerate models larger than the total VRAM capacity

The `llama.cpp` project is the main playground for developing new features for the [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) library.

## Obtaining and quantizing models

The [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co) platform hosts a [number of LLMs](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending) compatible with `llama.cpp`:

- [Trending](https://huggingface.co/models?library=gguf&sort=trending)
- [LLaMA](https://huggingface.co/models?sort=trending&search=llama+gguf)

You can either manually download the GGUF file or directly use any `llama.cpp`-compatible models from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) or other model hosting sites, by using this CLI argument: `-hf <user>/<model>[:quant]`. For example:

```sh
llama-cli -hf ggml-org/gemma-3-1b-it-GGUF
```

By default, the CLI would download from Hugging Face, you can switch to other options with the environment variable `MODEL_ENDPOINT`. The `MODEL_ENDPOINT` must point to a Hugging Face compatible API endpoint.

After downloading a model, use the CLI tools to run it locally - see below.

`llama.cpp` requires the model to be stored in the [GGUF](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md) file format. Models in other data formats can be converted to GGUF using the `convert_*.py` Python scripts in this repo.

The Hugging Face platform provides a variety of online tools for converting, quantizing and hosting models with `llama.cpp`:

- Use the [GGUF-my-repo space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo) to convert to GGUF format and quantize model weights to smaller sizes
- Use the [GGUF-my-LoRA space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-lora) to convert LoRA adapters to GGUF format (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/10123)
- Use the [GGUF-editor space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/CISCai/gguf-editor) to edit GGUF meta data in the browser (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/9268)
- Use the [Inference Endpoints](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/) to directly host `llama.cpp` in the cloud (more info: https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/9669)

To learn more about model quantization, [read this documentation](tools/quantize/README.md)

#### Seminal papers and background on the models

If your issue is with model generation quality, then please at least scan the following links and papers to understand the limitations of LLaMA models. This is especially important when choosing an appropriate model size and appreciating both the significant and subtle differences between LLaMA models and ChatGPT:
- LLaMA:
    - [Introducing LLaMA: A foundational, 65-billion-parameter large language model](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)
    - [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)
- GPT-3
    - [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)
- GPT-3.5 / InstructGPT / ChatGPT:
    - [Aligning language models to follow instructions](https://openai.com/research/instruction-following)
    - [Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)

## XCFramework
The XCFramework is a precompiled version of the library for iOS, visionOS, tvOS,
and macOS. It can be used in Swift projects without the need to compile the
library from source. For example:
```swift
// swift-tools-version: 5.10
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "MyLlamaPackage",
    targets: [
        .executableTarget(
            name: "MyLlamaPackage",
            dependencies: [
                "LlamaFramework"
            ]),
        .binaryTarget(
            name: "LlamaFramework",
            url: "https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/releases/download/b5046/llama-b5046-xcframework.zip",
            checksum: "c19be78b5f00d8d29a25da41042cb7afa094cbf6280a225abe614b03b20029ab"
        )
    ]
)
```
The above example is using an intermediate build `b5046` of the library. This can be modified
to use a different version by changing the URL and checksum.

## Completions
Command-line completion is available for some environments.

#### Bash Completion
```bash
$ build/bin/llama-cli --completion-bash > ~/.llama-completion.bash
$ source ~/.llama-completion.bash
```
Optionally this can be added to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` to load it
automatically. For example:
```console
$ echo "source ~/.llama-completion.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```
